# Customer Segmentation - Using K-means Algorithm

## About

Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. This project uses clustering to identify segments of customers, enabling targeted marketing strategies. Customers are divided into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits.

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization of customer demographics
- Analysis of annual incomes and spending scores
- K-means clustering based on:
  - Annual Income and Spending Score
  - Age and Spending Score
- Visualizations include distribution plots, count plots, box plots, violin plots, and heatmaps
- Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Cluster visualization and interpretation

## Dataset

The dataset contains 200 rows and 5 columns:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

## Usage

1. Install required libraries: 
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn

2. Run the Jupyter notebook `Customer-Segmentation.ipynb` to explore the data, visualize distributions, and perform clustering.

## Results

- Identified distinct customer segments based on income, age, and spending score.
- Visualized clusters and provided insights for targeted marketing.
